GUI for Romania map using Iterative Deepening Depth First Search algorithm with visualization of each step. User can select source and destination nodes.

Romania Map Traversal

This Python project provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for traversing the Romania map using the Iterative Deepening Depth First Search (IDDFS) algorithm. The program allows users to input a source and destination city on the map and visualize the algorithm's execution step by step.
Requirements

    Python 3.x
    Pygame
    Tkinter

Usage

    Run the script Romania_Map_Traversal.py.
    Enter the type of traversal ("idfs").
    Input the source and destination cities.
    Click the "Submit" button to initiate the traversal.
    The algorithm's execution will be visualized on the screen.
    Optionally, click the "Increase Depth" button to iterate the depth of the search.

Features

    GUI for Romania map traversal.
    Visualization of IDDFS algorithm execution.
    User-defined source and destination cities.
    Option to increase the depth of the search.

Note

Ensure that the required Python libraries (pygame and tkinter) are installed before running the script.
